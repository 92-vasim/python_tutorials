    "In Python, data types are categorized into two main categories: primitive (or simple) data types and non-primitive (or complex) data types. Let's define these two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primitive Data Types (Simple Data Types):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types, also known as simple data types, are the fundamental building blocks for representing basic values in Python. They are directly supported by the programming language and are used to represent single values. Python has several primitive data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integer (`int`):** Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without a fractional component. For example: `5`, `-42`, `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Floating-Point (`float`):** Represents real numbers, including those with decimal points. For example: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `2.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Boolean (`bool`):** Represents two values, `True` and `False`, used for logical operations and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **String (`str`):** Represents text or sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. For example: `\"Hello, world!\"`, `'Python'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Primitive Data Types (Complex Data Types):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-primitive data types, also known as complex data types, are more advanced data structures that can hold collections of values or objects. They are composed of one or more primitive data types and are not directly built into the language but are implemented using classes and structures. Python provides several non-primitive data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List (`list`):** Represents an ordered collection of values, which can be of different data types. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents (add, remove, modify elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tuple (`tuple`):** Similar to a list but immutable (cannot be changed once created). Tuples are typically used for situations where you want a collection of values that should not be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dictionary (`dict`):** Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Keys are typically strings or numbers, and values can be of various data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set (`set`):** Represents an unordered collection of unique values. Sets are useful for operations like checking for uniqueness and set arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Frozen Set (`frozenset`):** Similar to a set but immutable, like tuples. Once created, the elements in a frozenset cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Custom Classes and Objects:** Python allows you to create custom classes and objects to represent complex data structures tailored to your specific needs. These can be considered non-primitive data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-primitive data types provide greater flexibility for organizing and working with data in more complex ways compared to primitive data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primitive data types in Python represent basic single values, while non-primitive data types allow you to work with collections of values or objects in more advanced ways. Both categories have their uses in programming, depending on the complexity of the data you need to handle."
